# Solar Radiation Prediction

This was a Kaggle competition. You can find it here https://www.kaggle.com/c/solar-energy-prediction-datamex0320/overview

The dataset contains columns such as wind speed and direction, humidity or temperature. The competition is to predict solar radiation based on those data. There are 4 months of data.

The error metric is the MSE, therefore, the lower the better the result.

#### The units of each column are:

- Radiation: Solar radiation in watts per meter ^ 2
- Temperature: Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
- Humidity: Humidity in %
- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure in mm Hg
- WindDirection (degrees): Wind direction in degrees
- Speed: Wind speed in miles per hour
- Sunrise / sunset: Sunrise-Sunset (Hawaii time)
- UNIXTime: TimeStamp (seconds from 01-01-1970)
- Data: Date
- Time: Time



##### Got third place with a MSE of 6173.56542.
